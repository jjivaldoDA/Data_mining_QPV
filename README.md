# Data_mining_QPV

As part of my Master's program at IAE Gustave Eiffel (2021), we conducted a project analyzing 100 political districts in France. The study focused on the economic structure within these priority urban areas (QPV). Using various data analysis and classification techniques, we aimed to understand the differences between types of establishments in these districts and how their distribution affects the rate of precarious employment. Precarious employment includes all non-permanent contracts such as fixed-term contracts, temporary work, and subsidized contracts.

Our approach included creating and presenting the database, followed by descriptive statistics like means, standard deviations, coefficients of variation, and a correlation matrix. We performed principal component analysis (PCA), k-means clustering, hierarchical clustering, decision tree analysis, and concluded with logistic regression to identify key insights and patterns.
